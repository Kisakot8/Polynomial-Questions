# Polynomial Questions
> Generates questions about cubic/3rd degree polynomials.

The 2 types of question are (where f(x) is the cubic polynomial):
- Prove (ax-b) is a factor of f(x).
  - This question has a part b.: Fully factorise f(x).
- Prove (ax-b) is NOT a factor of f(x), where f(x).

This is meant to be done with the long division method and NOT the GCM (greatest common factor) method, although the latter may still work by sheer randomness.
